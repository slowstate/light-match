TUTORIAL_INTRO_1,Hello,,
TUTORIAL_INTRO_2,Welcome to Test Facility 003,,
TUTORIAL_INTRO_3,I am 4DM1N-D2 and I will be your training coordinator,,
TUTORIAL_MOVEMENT_1,"First, let's test your basic motor functions",,
TUTORIAL_MOVEMENT_2,"In a moment, I will create a target - destroy it",,
TUTORIAL_MOVEMENT_3,"Press W, A, S, D to move around, mouse to aim, and left-click to fire your gun",,
TUTORIAL_COLOURS_1,"Hm, guess that doesn't work. Try matching colours with the target",,
TUTORIAL_COLOURS_2,"Use 1, 2, and 3 or scroll wheel to change your colour",,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_1,That worked. Let's calibrate your optic algorithm next,,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_2,See those hexagons above your head? Together they're called a Sequence,,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_3,Destroy targets that match the colour of each hexagon from left to right to complete the Sequence,,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_4,"For every Sequence you complete, you get closer to unlocking your full potential",,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_5,Try to complete a Sequence by destroying this target,,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_6,"Too bad, you failed to complete the Sequence because the target was the wrong colour",,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_7,"If the Sequence doesn't match the colour of the targets, you can refresh it by pressing R. Give it try",,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_8,Looks like you've got the hang of it now,,
TUTORIAL_OUTRO_1,Time for the real test,,
TUTORIAL_OUTRO_2,3.. 2.. 1..,,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_FAILED,"Not quite, give it another try. Press R to refresh the Sequence",,
