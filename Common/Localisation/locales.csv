TUTORIAL_INTRO_1,Hello,
TUTORIAL_INTRO_2,Welcome to Test Facility 003,
TUTORIAL_INTRO_3,I am 4DM1N-D2 and I will be your training coordinator,
TUTORIAL_MOVEMENT_1,"First, let's test your basic motor functions",
TUTORIAL_MOVEMENT_2,"In a moment, I will create a target - destroy it",
TUTORIAL_MOVEMENT_3,"Press W, A, S, D to move around, mouse to aim, and left-click to fire your gun",
TUTORIAL_COLOURS_1,"Hm, guess that doesn't work. Try matching colors with the target",
TUTORIAL_COLOURS_2,"Use 1, 2, and 3 or scroll wheel to change your color",
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_1,"That worked. Next, let's calibrate your optic algorithm",
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_2,See those hexagons above your head? Together they're called a Sequence,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_3,Destroy targets that match the color of each hexagon from left to right to complete the Sequence,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_4,"For every Sequence you complete, you get closer to unlocking your evolutionary potential",
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_5,Try to complete a Sequence by destroying this target,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_6,"Too bad, you failed to complete the Sequence because the target was the wrong color",
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_7,"If the Sequence doesn't match the color of the targets, you can refresh it by pressing R. Give it try",

TUTORIAL_OUTRO_1,Time for the real test,
TUTORIAL_OUTRO_2,3.. 2.. 1..,
TUTORIAL_SEQUENCE_FAILED,"Not quite, give it another try. Press R to refresh the Sequence",
